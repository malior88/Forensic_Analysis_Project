# Forensic Analysis Project

A forensic analysis project using tools like **binwalk**, **foremost**, **bulk_extractor**, and **volatility** to extract data, analyze memory dumps, and identify sensitive information. The project automates data extraction, processes disk images and memory files, and provides detailed analysis logs and outputs.

## Description

This forensic analysis project involves the use of several popular tools to perform the following tasks:

- **binwalk**: Used to extract files and analyze the contents of firmware and disk images. It's effective for identifying embedded files and file signatures.
- **foremost**: A file carving tool that is used to recover files from raw disk images, focusing on extracting recognizable file types.
- **bulk_extractor**: A tool designed to extract useful data such as emails, credit card information, and more from disk and memory images.
- **volatility**: A memory analysis framework used to extract valuable information from memory dumps, including running processes, network connections, and more.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: The project automates the extraction of files and sensitive data from memory dumps and disk images using the tools mentioned.
- **Memory Analysis**: Utilizes **volatility** to analyze memory dumps and uncover details about running processes, network activity, and other relevant data.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Logs and reports are automatically generated to document the results of each tool's operation, providing a detailed overview of the analysis.
- **Data Storage**: All analysis results and extracted files are stored in organized output directories for easy access and review.
